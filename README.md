# Software Development Plan

## Purpose and Scope

This application is based on music theory, primarily keys and chords. It allows the user to enter one or multiple chords and will generate a list of keys based on the chords entered. Selecting one of the listed keys will display all chords associated with the key. From here it gives the option to display all the notes of an entered chord. Main menu and sub menus allow for easy navigation moving back and forward between keys and chords. Keys and chords can also be searched and displayed directly from the main menu.

The program will solve a range of problems. Songwriters need to know what key they are in to further develop songs. Western music and harmony is based around keys, chords and scales. Having the ability to identify the key a piece of music is in based on the chords being used will contribute heavily to songwriting. It allows the musician to expand their creation and develop as a songwriter. It's a useful learning tool to be come familiar with keys and their associated chords and by extension, music theory.

Musicians and amatuer song writers not familiar with music theory will be it's main audience. Beginners learning an instrument will get an introduction into theory. Professional musicians and those familiar with music theory can use it as a quick reference.

If a songwriter comes up with a piece based on a couple of chords, it will allow find out the full range of chords and notes to help a piece expand and sound complete. Key changes and other elaborate song writing will be possible.

## Features

The first feature of the terminal application is the ability to search musical keys by chord or chords contained in the keys. The code contains a long list of major and minor keys.

The user then can select any of these keys and a list of all the chords corresponding to that selected key are displayed. For further information about this key, the user can select any of the chords listed to find out which notes make up that chord. With the help of a sub menu, its easy to navigate between the listed key and displaying the contents of the keys chords.
